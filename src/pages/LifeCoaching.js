				In life, we all put ourselves in boxes from time to time, and while these boxes might help us define ourselves, they can often get in the way of our growth. 

				As a life coach it is my goal to help you break out of your box, and access the extraordinary potential that lies within you to realize your highest goals, and live with ever more joy and gratitude. 

				Some life coaches believe that the only way to get anywhere in life is hard work. Others will tell you all you need to do is to change your beliefs and you can manifest your wildest dreams. 

				I believe that while each of these strategies alone can produce results, nothing compares to bringing these two hemispheres of creation together.

				This is not about motivation, which comes and goes. This is about working with you to define what it is you truly want, and why you want it. This is about removing the blocks from the unconscious mind that can derail you. And this is about getting clear and focused BEFORE the hard work begins so that your hard work, and your most important goals are aligned and every part of you is working towards the same direction.

				Let me tell you, I've been through hell. I came up through hell. 


				I've been through poverty, addiction, PTSD, chronic illness, anxiety, pain, fatigue, and more. I had to fight through all of that and dig deep, deep into my soul to find out who I truly am and what I truly want. 


				Check out my bio page for the full story.

				What I truly want is to live in a beautiful place with a deep connection to nature, have great friends, and be a positive part of my community. I want to be a good husband to my beautiful soul mate. I want to have more than enough money to live the life of my dreams. I want to help people all over the world turn their deepest darkness into their most powerful fuel. And that is what I am doing today! 

				I also am a Certified Life Coach through the renowned School Achology, a certified Ho'Oponopono Practitioner, and a certified Reiki Master. I have many years of experience with a number of tranformative practices. (See the MODALITIES tab for the full list!)
