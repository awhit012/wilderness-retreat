				My clients have the opportunity to work with me one on one via Zoom from 2x a week to monthy, for between 15 minutes and 2 hours.

				Trauma is one of the most serious and important things in life. It can break us down. It can challenge us to our depths. But it can be a lonely path, full of pitfalls, diversions, and snake oil salesmen. 
			</p>


			<p className="container">
				Trauma Recovery Coaching is about having someone in your corner every week or month, who's been through it all. Someone who's tried dozens of healing modalities, spent thousands of dollars, and who can guide you onto your most effective healing timeline.
			</p>

			<p className="container">
				As a Trauma Recovery Coach, my goal is to guide you to a very specific place on your healing journey: That moment when you realize that what once held you back in life now fuels you and pushes you forward. 
			</p>

			<p className="container">
				When you get to that point, everything changes. Whereas you used to struggle to survive, now you thrive with ease, because what you went through was so much harder than most of what life demands of us. We become powerful beings fueled by our past. Not powered anger or resentment. But powered by love and determination. 
			</p>

			<p className="container">
				As a Trauma Recovery Coach, I also tap into my training as a Certified Life Coach through the renowned School Achology. I am also a certified Ho'Oponopono Practitioner, and a certified Reiki Master. I have many years of experience with a number of tranformative practices. (See the MODALITIES tab for the full list!)
