            <h2>Discovering My Path</h2>
              <p> 
                A near death experience
                ultimately led me to question my
                life's existence aligning me to
                seek more from within. This shift
                brought me to Japan. The
                surrendering to the unknown was
                a miracle of transformations. I 
                explored ancient & indigenous
                rituals for awakening to one's true
                nature, healing and purification
                therapies. My first Shaman
                teacher came in 2000 to initiate
                my inner gifts. Now, 18 years later,
                I work & volunteer as a multi-
                disciplinary Healing Artist
                specializing in Spiritual Growth &
                Human Potential.
              </p> 
              <p>
                My daily practice is to use these
                tools for balance. Eight areas of
                importance: Health, wealth,
                family/ friends, play/ fun/ hobbies,
                Relationships, Career/ work,
                Personal space and
                contributions/spirituality. By
                daily tuning in and being open to
                spirit, I am aligning myself with
                the bigger plan. Being a bridge
                between heaven and earth is what I am about.
                My intention is
                see adversity & vulnerabilities
                as opportunities to strengthen my
                core, focus and remain heart
                centered. My wish is that this
                connection to oness sharpens my
                intuition to allow this path of
                service to be more impactful.

            <h2>Polarity Therapy Principles</h2>
              <p> 
                A comprehensive bodywork
                modality incorporating diet,
                exercise and light touch. This
                synthesis of many wisdoms
                mainly influenced by the East is
                primarily based on the principles
                of physics, the law that everything
                is energy and is a constant.
                Human being are in between the
                negative and positive poles of
                earth and sky therefore effecting
                us when not in alignment. Polarity
                works with all the bodies systems
                energetically from chakras to the
                nervous system.

                wave connected between the
                cranium and sacrum allow for the
                balancing of the whole
                body. Gently reorganizing and
                restoring the body balance with
                the lightest of touch. From head
                injuries, hormone out of balances
                and muscle pain this modality
                can go deep into some of the
                oldest patterns of the psyche to
                heal the concerning issues.
